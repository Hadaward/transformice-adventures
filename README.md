# Transformice Adventures
This is my job to help the Transformice Adventures community, a game that was developed in HTML 5 by Atelier 801 and that is still in the demo version, containing several bugs that disturb the players. My efforts are to fix most of the bugs present in the game.

I intend to release extensions for browsers that support Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey, as well as fixes for the steam version and create my own standalone.

## patch.js
This file is dynamically loaded by extensions and contains code that is injected into the game to make corrections. The steam version has its standalone modified to load this file.
