# Transformice Adventures
This is my job to help the Transformice Adventures community, a game that was developed in HTML 5 by Atelier 801 and that is still in the demo version, containing several bugs that disturb the players. My efforts are to fix most of the bugs present in the game.

I intend to release extensions for browsers that support Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey, as well as fixes for the steam version and create my own standalone.

## extensions
This branch contains the code used in the development of scripts to patch the game in the browser using the TamperMonkey and GreaseMonkey extensions. Remembering that these scripts only induce the game to load the file [patch.js](/../main/patch.js) who is responsible for applying game patches.
