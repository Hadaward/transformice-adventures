# Transformice Adventures
This is my job to help the Transformice Adventures community, a game that was developed in HTML 5 by Atelier 801 and that is still in the demo version, containing several bugs that disturb the players. My efforts are to fix most of the bugs present in the game.

I intend to release extensions for browsers that support Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey, as well as fixes for the steam version and create my own standalone.

## Steam
This branch contains the code used to develop the binary that updates the Transformice Adventures standalone steam, for now it is only supported for windows.
